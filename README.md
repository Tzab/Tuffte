## Chapter 6
1. **Four considerations for  efficiency statistical graphics.**
     - Complexity, Structure, Desity & Beauty
2. **Will audience looking at the new designs be confused?**
     - No, some are self explanatory, others are more difficult but the audience should never be underestimated
3. **Type of diagram that combine the marginal frequency distribution and the bivariate distribution.** 
     - The dot-dash-plot.
4. **The imperfect empirical representation of an underlying curve that transforms one variable into another.** 
     - Bivariate scatter
## Chapter 7
1. **What are the main 3 considerations for the viewing depth at graphics?**
     - What is seen from a distance
     - what is seen up close & in detail
     - what is seen implicity
2. **If a graphic must be interpreted through a verbal rather than a visual process the data graphics is a ...:** 
     - visual puzzle
3. **What is the danger of  multifunctioning elements?**
   - They tend to generate graphical puzzles
4. **The graphical element that actually locates or plots the data is the:**
     - data measure
## Chapter 8
1. **What is the formula for the data density of a graphic?:** 
     - number of entries in data matrix/(area of data graphic)
2. **3 characteristics of well designed small multiples:**
     - Inevitably comparative
     - Usually based on a large data matrix
     - Efficent in interpretation
3. **How to modify the data density of a graphic?:** 
     - modifing the size of the graph

4. **What is the ideal data density of a graph?:** 
     - .5 
## Chapter 9
1. **Guide to display attractive statistical information:**
     - have a properly chosen format and design:

     - use words, numbers, and drawing together

     - reflect a balance, a proportion, a sense of relevant scale

     - display an accessible complexity of detail

     - often have a narrative quality, a story to tell about the data

     - are drawn in a professional manner, with the technical details of production done with care

     - avoid content-free decoration, including chartjunk.

2. **The best way to show exact numerical values & work well when the data presentation requires many localized comparison:** 
     - Tables
3. **It is a poor way to show more than two numbers because it prevents comparisons within the data:** 
     - The conventional sentence
4. **What is the principle of data/text integration?** 
     - Data graphics are paragraphs about data and should be treated as such
